# sagemath-scripts

This repository hosts diverse scripts that I developed to ease the use of [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) or to adapt it to my own purposes. Note that the scripts are, for the most part, draft versions that I've created with my own applications in mind and thus may need some fine tuning to be usable for different purposes. **I gladly welcome improvements and suggestions.**
